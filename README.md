# VGG Web

![VGG hero image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verygoodgraphics/vgg_web/resources/assets/imgs/vgg_web_container.jpg)

A JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Vue/Svelte and Web Assembly ([WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)) runtime library for [VGG](https://verygoodgraphics.com/).

This library allows full control over Daruma files with a high-level API for hooking up many simple interactions, as well as a low-level API that allows you to drive your own render loop to create multiple artboards all in one canvas.
